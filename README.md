In this project we were in charge of implementing the Q learning algorithm in the code. The rest of the code was provided by SNHU.
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are experts who focus on creating and building computer systems, software, and applications. To build effective, dependable, and secure systems that can handle challenging challenges, they draw on their experience in mathematics, algorithms, data structures, and other computational methods. Computers have become an essential aspect of our lives, making the job of computer scientists essential in the modern world.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
A a computer scientist, there are certain steps I will take when presented with a problem:

    Recognize the issue: Begin with comprehending the issue you are attempting to resolve. Determine the problem's requirements, restrictions, and             constraints. Establish the aims and goals of the solution you're trying to develop.

    assemble information Gather all the pertinent data and information that will be useful in resolving the issue. Search for already-used solutions or         previously-solved issues that are comparable to yours.

    Break Down the Problem: Divide the issue into more manageable, smaller pieces. Determine the various elements that require attention and how they           relate to one another.

    Create a solution: After deconstructing the issue, start formulating a plan of action that addresses each of the subordinate issues. Identify the           programming languages, data structures, and techniques that will most effective for the solution.
    
    Implement the solution.
    
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
It is my ethical duty as a computer scientist to ensure that the rights of the user are respected at every time.
